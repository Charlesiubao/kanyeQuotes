# KanyeREST quote generator

It's time to use our newfound knowledge of AJAX to create something really useful. 

Have you ever felt down? Moved from informed pessimism into the valley of despair? In those times of trouble, Kanye West quotes come to you, speaking words of wisdom and truth, via [the Kanye.REST API](https://kanye.rest/).

### Goals

* Make a call to the Kanye.REST API to receive a nugget of wisdom from the Grammy Award winning performer.
* Display the wisdom on the page _(in a way that inspires)_
* Have a button that a user can push to receive **another** gem from the father of four

The main goal of this deliverable is to introduce you to 3rd party APIs and show you the possibilities. KanyeREST is a simple API, but there are more complicated ones out there if you finish the main goals early.

### Resources

* [Notes on AJAX and Fetch](https://gawdiseattle.gitbook.io/wdi/00readme/ajax-fetch)
* [Kanye REST API site featuring an example GET request](https://kanye.rest/)

## Bonus

* Style your inspirational site!
* Make a call to [ICanHazDadJoke](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api) or another quote API, either randomly generate which call gets made or make a separate button
> NOTE: ICanHazDadJoke requires headers to be sent with the request so you might have to look up how to use headers with Fetch or craft your own XML request using vanilla Javascript!
